Leetcode 62. Unique Paths
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
How many possible unique paths are there?
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        if(m==1||n==1)return 1;
        vector<int> r(n,1);
        for(int i=m-2;i>-1;i--){
            r[n-1]=1;
            for(int j=n-2;j>-1;j--)r[j]+=r[j+1];
        }return r[0];
    }
};
