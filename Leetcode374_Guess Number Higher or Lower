Leetcode374. Guess Number Higher or Lower
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.
You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):
-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
Example:
n = 10, I pick 6.
Return 6.
(Simple Binary Search)
// Forward declaration of guess API.
// @param num, your guess
// @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
int guess(int num);
class Solution {
public:
    int guessNumber(int n) {
        int lo=1;int hi=n; int m=(lo+hi)/2;
        while(hi>lo){
            if(hi%2==1&&lo%2==1) m=lo/2+hi/2+1;
            else m=lo/2+hi/2; 
            if(guess(m)==0) return m;
            else if(guess(m)>0) lo=m+1;
            else hi=m-1;
        }return lo;
    }
};
